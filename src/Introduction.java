    // About Java
    // Java is an slang for coffe, because one island that planned coffe in the 1600s called Java.
    // It's a high level, object oriented programing language that can be ran anywhere, because it compiles the code and
    // runs it in an virtual machine (JVM), in any OS.
    // It required an JRE and JVM to work.
    // When you compile an C code for example, it builds it code into "machine code", a build for the used OS and it's configurations,
    // that your machine reads. If you try to run it an diferent system, it's will not work.
    // But when you build Java code, it generates an byte code that the JVM reads, not the machine itself, so you can be in any system with the JDK installed,
    // and your Java code will work.

    // About JDK - Java Development Kit
    // It's a cross-plataform software development kit that provides tools and libraries
    // needed to build java-based applications and applets.

    // It includes the following:

    // JRE (Java Runtime Environment) - Are the tools used by java programs and required for then to run,
    // like libs (System.*, java.utils.*, java.lang.*, and etc.);

    // Development Tools - Are the tools and commands used in java development;

    // JVM (Java Virtual Machine) - It's java's virtual machine used to run java code;
